# Common errors

Here is a list of common errors and how you can fix them.

# Dependencies aren't up to date

The packages used in this repository get updated often. That is why it is always worth a try updating those if you get an error like `invalid URL: undefined` or when the bot crashes when running the play command.

# FFMPEG is not installed on the machine running the bot

The `/play` command requires FFMPEG to be installed on the machine that is running the bot. You can download it on the official [FFMPEG website](https://www.ffmpeg.org/).
